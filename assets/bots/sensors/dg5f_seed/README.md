## Mounting adapter CAD

[`step/DG5F_Seed_Fingertip_Mount.STEP`](step/DG5F_Seed_Fingertip_Mount.STEP) contains the mounting adapter CAD matching [`render/dg5f_link_tip_render.glb`](render/dg5f_link_tip_render.glb).

The mounting adapter STEP is distributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0)](step/LICENSE), with attribution to Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates. This license applies only to the STEP file.

The STEP coordinates are in millimeters. To align them with the physical mount-link frame, use `(x, y, z) = (STEP_z, STEP_x, STEP_y - 11)`, then convert to meters for SuperDex.
